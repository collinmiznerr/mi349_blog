            <p>At the start of the band's career, they were known as the New Yardbirds but then later changed their name to Led Zeppelin and was formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page. The band consisted of Page (guitarist), Robert Plant (lead singer), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drummer). The band had many different sounds ranging from early rock and roll, psychedelic rock, blues, and folk. Led Zeppelin took this music and added a bottom-heavy, loud, gritty, and powerful rock electric style to it and gave them leverage for great influence. Led Zeppelin is best known for their song “Stairway to Heaven” which is an eight minute epic ballad of Rock n Roll's greatest song. The band had enormous success and is considered one of the best and most influential bands of all time. With Pages heavy guitar, Plants howling vocals, Jones articulated bass, and Bonhams thunderous drums, these four can be considered music Gods. Some other notable songs by Led Zeppelin are Kashmir (my personal favorite), Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, The Ocean, and Good Times Bad Times just to name a few. Overall, the band is full of talent, however, did they steal their music? That is a topic for another day lol. Hint: no.
