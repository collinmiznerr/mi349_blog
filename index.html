            <p>At the start of the band's career, they were known as the New Yardbirds but then later changed their name to Led Zeppelin and was formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page. The band consisted of Page (guitarist), Robert Plant (lead singer), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drummer). The band had many different sounds ranging from early rock and roll, psychedelic rock, blues, and folk. Led Zeppelin took this music and added a bottom-heavy, loud, gritty, and powerful rock electric style to it and gave them leverage for great influence. Led Zeppelin is best known for their song “Stairway to Heaven” which is an eight minute epic ballad of Rock n Roll's greatest song. The band had enormous success and is considered one of the best and most influential bands of all time. With Pages heavy guitar, Plants howling vocals, Jones articulated bass, and Bonhams thunderous drums, these four can be considered music Gods. Some other notable songs by Led Zeppelin are Kashmir (my personal favorite), Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, The Ocean, and Good Times Bad Times just to name a few. Overall, the band is full of talent, however, did they steal their music? That is a topic for another day lol. Hint: no.

            <p>Led Zeppelin is obviously not the only notable band for the time (1960s-1970s). Some of my personal favorites would be The Beatles, The Who, The Doors, Black Sabbath, and Jimmi Hendrix. All of these bands had great influence over music and rock history. Each of these bands also came with unique sounds for the time. With The Beatles introducing Britpop, The Doors incorporating jazz and blues into their sound, and Black Sabbath being one of the first heavy metal bands to hit the scene, it is needless to say that these early classic rock bands had music history in a choke hold. Similar to Led Zeppelin, these bands also had great influential guitarists. The Who had Pete Townsend who trademarked the windmill guitar swing and heavy guitar sound. Black Sabbath had Tony Iommi who had his signature D# guitar tuning which set the stage for heavy metal. Lastly Jimmi Hendrix, arguably the greatest guitarist of all time. He is said to have created the modern electric guitar sound. Hendrix also had one of the greatest performances of the national anthem in music history at Woodstock 1969. Overall, along with Led Zeppelin, all of these bands had a great influence in music history. These bands are the ones that I have grown up on and they still hold some of my favorites to this day.
