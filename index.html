            <p>At the start of the band's career, they were known as the New Yardbirds but then later changed their name to Led Zeppelin and was formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page. The band consisted of Page (guitarist), Robert Plant (lead singer), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drummer). The band had many different sounds ranging from early rock and roll, psychedelic rock, blues, and folk. Led Zeppelin took this music and added a bottom-heavy, loud, gritty, and powerful rock electric style to it and gave them leverage over other rock bands during the time.
